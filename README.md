# meteor-jinx
A simple toolbox for Meteor, made in CoffeeScript, containing:

- **a command line interface** (CLI)
- **Atom.io integration**

This is not an official Meteor supported package. But this package surely supports [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com). Jinx toolbox needs Meteor to be installed.

## About
The Jinx toolbox is merely something that can ease you into development in Meteor if you come from the world of generators and being lazy. Its current version is **0.0.2**, so don't think it will marvel you (at all).

## Installation
