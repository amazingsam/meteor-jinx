# meteor-jinx
A simple toolbox for Meteor, made in CoffeeScript, containing:

- **a command line interface** (CLI)
- **Atom.io integration**

This is not an official Meteor supported package. But this package surely supports [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com). Jinx toolbox needs Meteor to be installed.

## About
The Jinx toolbox is merely something that can ease you into development in Meteor if you come from the world of generators and being lazy. Its current version is **0.0.7**, so don't think it will marvel you (at all).

The difference between other available CLI and toolboxes is that it is aimed to generate CoffeeScript output, has some lazy options to save time -- or better said effort. Another philosophy is that it easily to customize. You don't need to be a superior codeninja to change package structures; basic understanding of CoffeeScript and JSON is more than enough to get you there.

Because of the CoffeeScript output, it will have a build tool too. Also, because its intention to use for industrial solutions, it works with testing strategies, various stages of deployment and auto documentation.
